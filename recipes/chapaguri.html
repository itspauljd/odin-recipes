                Cook the steak and sear them evenly all sides, about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Now, add cooked noodles into the steak along with both seasoning packages and butter. 
                Add 1/2 to 3/4 cup of the ramen noodle water into the skillet and mix everything together, until everything is well combined, about 1 minute. 
                Add 2 tbsp more ramen noodle water as needed. Transfer to a serving bowl and enjoy!</li>
